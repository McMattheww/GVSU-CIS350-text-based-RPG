# Text-Based-RPG

The main feature of the game is you have a player character with certain statistics, health points, hunger level, inventory, etc. 
As you engage in combat with enemies or deal with environemtal hazards, these statistics are affected. 
Where the player is in the game world will be tracked on a room-by-room basis, like the different rooms of a dungeon.
