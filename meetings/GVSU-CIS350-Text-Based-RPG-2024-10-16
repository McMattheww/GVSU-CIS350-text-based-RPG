Discussion points:
* For the presentation its more of just a demo and explaining what the project will be about
* The UML diagram and some stuff about how the game works
* Not so much explaining how to play the game but more just what it is like
* How tasks should flow and how having a small amount of tasks can be a good thing because of an increased sense of accomplishment
* Chose Pygame and tested with pyinstaller includes graphics and input which is all we will need 
* Overall only need pygame and pyinstaller similar functionality to Tkinter
* What would be considered functional and non-functional: some functional would be a way to save the game; non functional would be stuff like performance of the game and how fast it runs and availability
* Developement status where we are in that area
* split the tickets half and half between each other which ones we were going to do and what we are more comfortable with
* Fallout topic sci-fi or maybe post apocalypse/Fantasy
* 

Goals for next week (include responsibilities)
* Create a gantt or burn down chart
* Plan out project and what we should speak to how the game is working and maybe some non functional stuff we are trying to include
* refine our functional and non-functional requirements and list them out for how we want our game to look
* Possibly start the sprint? after presentation will start sprint
* Add a public access to github for our specific links to what we are working on* Decide what our game name is
* Decide on if there should be 4 players or just the one player for time constraints and difficulty with including that in the coding portion of the project
*
