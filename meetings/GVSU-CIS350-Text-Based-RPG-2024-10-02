Discussion points:
* Milestone one refining requirements
* Creating tickets/diagram for Jira
* Reason for picking Jira: Trello is more generalized and not as computing specific 
* Basic Gameplay mechanics such as world layout
* UML Diagrams 
* Possible Bloated requirements and maybe cutting them up into smaller peices tomake the requirements more precise
* talked about trello being a more recent developement and having a more colorful UI so possibly using Trello instead
* Trello having some good templates to use possibly better than Jira
* Which executable we are using-> PyInstaller executable progress -> Found? Not Found?
* What is being used for the GUI and if we have decided on anything along those lines yet or not
* For GUI using PyGame and mostly text based imaging or possibly creating basic imaging like squares and circles to represent the player and where enemies might be
* 

Goals for next week (include responsibilities)
* Get PyInstaller onto our computers and package it so it is distributable in our game
* Create a Trello board and get all team members on board and create some of the first ticket list of tasks that need to be completed
* Decide on other roles and responsibilities
* Update roles on github and responsibilites 
* Documented what is being done on github for professors
* Decide what executable
* Create basic Templates for Trello
* Look into tkinter for GUI and possibly using that for our game
* Create a communication schedule for the team about reaching out to each other most likely every other day
*
