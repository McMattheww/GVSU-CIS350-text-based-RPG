Discussion points:
* Code that was written and how it all interacts and works
* Currently only has one test level and terminates once characters hit points reach 0
* Rooms being randomly generated and not pre determined
* game logic is already in a semi playable state with a set of rooms and coordinates
* Estimated a week for UI and message log to be created
* Talked about trying to keep it simple but overall if it works for us it is good
* Collision in terms of same squares with the character and enemies and also enemies with enemies -> could possilby be restricted for now until more progress is made and more is figured out
	* Use one guy per square and tougher enemies and attack adjacent squares
* Keep tasks maximum of 6-8 hours per task and lower if possible
* Current map set up is straight lines (corridors) to avoid having to deal with diagnol sight
* Connecting git hub to pycharm to possibly make it easier to transfer code over to the git repository
* Branches on git repository how to create them locally and push them to the git hub where they will reflect the changes directly on github
* 

Goals for next week (include responsibilities)
* Get a UI created and working
* Finish up current sprint with new logic that was added
* Rendering of map squares and enemies
* Figure out how to deal with multiple enemies in the same square
* Figure out in pygame how to place text somewhere in a window
* Define formulas to check all map squares in a certain radius of the player 
* Revisit and fix Use Case Diagram extended description 
	* Use case title/description along with other stuff
* Move entites file to src folder instead of in artifacts folder
* Complete HW 4 Part 1 by this friday
* Go through project proposal document and make any changes if there are any to what was originally drafted
* push all code
* Do a high level code review
*
