# Attack - player character

The attack function of the player character is dependent on a couple of factors.
 The main factor is the weapon the player has equipped.
 If no weapon is equipped the player is automatically given a weak "unarmed" weapon.
 All weapons have durabilty that lowers with use, when it gets to a certain level weapon performance is worsened.
 Ranged weapons require ammunition to attack.
 weapons have a different attack types, mellee weapons have different levels of atack ferocity that use more/less stamina, ranged weapons have fire modes that trade rate of fire for accuracy.
